Halo~! My name is Jiexin, you can also call me Judy. <br />

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with [Dr. Eiji Uchibe](https://researchmap.jp/uchibe/) at the department of [Brain Robot Interface](https://bicr.atr.jp/bri/), ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories. <br />

I spent my PhD years under the supervisions of [Prof. Shin Ishii](http://ishiilab.jp/member/ishii/) at [Integrated Systems Biology Lab](http://ishiilab.jp/kyoto/en/), Grad School of Informatics, Kyoto University, and [Prof. Kenji Doya](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu/kenji-doya) at [Adaptive Systems Group](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu/adaptive-systems-group), [Neural Computation Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu), Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST).<br />

During Phd, I developed an affordable and sustainable smartphone robotic platform to investigate artificial intelligence, mainly from the perspective of Reinforcement Learning to understand animal and human behaviors. <br />

My current research lies in investigating how separating reward and pain apart from traditional RL reward setting could help for exploration and improving data efficiency.

Personally, I am a mountain girl in a pre-alpinist level.
