Halo~! My name is Jiexin, you can also call me Judy. <br /><br /> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the department of [Brain Robot Interface](https://bicr.atr.jp/bri/), ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories. I used to be a PhD student at [Integrated Systems Biology Lab](http://ishiilab.jp/kyoto/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shin Ishii](http://ishiilab.jp/member/ishii/), Grad School of Informatics, Kyoto University. And a research assistant at [Adaptive Systems Group](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu/adaptive-systems-group), [Neural Computation Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu), Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST).<br /><br /> I mainly work with [Prof. Kenji Doya](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu/kenji-doya) and [Dr. Eiji Uchibe](https://researchmap.jp/uchibe/) for developing an affordable and sustainable smartphone robotic platform to investigate artificial intelligence and understand animal and human behaviors.<br /><br />My current research interest is developing efficient (deep) reinforcement learning methods for real-world mobile and joint robots.
