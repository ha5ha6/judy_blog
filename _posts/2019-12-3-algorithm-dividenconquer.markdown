### Definition

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps.

1. Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
2. Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems
3. Combine: Appropriately combine the answers

A classic example of Divide and Conquer is **Merge Sort** demonstrated below.  
In Merge Sort, we divide array into two halves, sort the two halves recursively, and then merge the sorted halves.
